# jekyll-blog
Source and templates etc. for [my jekyll-powered site](https://rumorsmatrix). I see no good reason why anyone would use this instead of a fresh [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) install, but here it is. I keep the actuall markdown content in the `_posts/` directory in a different repository, and don't commit `assets/images/*`.

## Additional stuff

 - new theme templates, css etc.
 - tagging with [pattex/jekyll-tagging](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging)
 - pagination via [jekyll-paginate](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) gem
