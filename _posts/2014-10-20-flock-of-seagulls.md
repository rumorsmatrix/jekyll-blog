Can I just say how happy I am with CCP and <em>EVE Online</em> with CCP Seagull at the helm?

> So, in December you'll see the first signs of another... kind of symbolic change, which is that we will start adding things to the universe again, in a bigger way than we have done in quite some time [...] We are super excited about all of this, it's a fantastic privilege to make what I think is the world's greatest sandbox together with all of you, and with those two goals in mind — strengthening everything that's amazing and unique about EVE Online, and making your experience with EVE better — I think we're in for a super exciting 2015 with EVE Online, and I hope to see you all there. Thank you very much.
